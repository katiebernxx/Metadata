# Ubongo Metadata Extraction Tools
Welcome to the Ubongo Metadata Extraction Tools repository! This project contains tools developed to extract valuable metadata from Ubongo's scripts and videos, enhancing the searchability of content and aiding in the creation of tailored learning journeys for children.

## Overview
Ubongo is Africa's leading edu-tainment company, creating engaging educational media in various languages for children across the continent. As part of our mission to improve access to quality education, this repository includes two key tools for metadata extraction:

<b>Script Metadata Extractor</b>: Analyzes scripts to identify the frequency of characters' speech and the predominant moods throughout the script.  
<b>Video Metadata Extractor</b>: Analyzes video files to determine their beats per minute (BPM), which can be used for content tagging.

These tools are hosted on Streamlit and can be accessed here: [Script](https://scriptmetadata.streamlit.app/) [AV](https://bpmanalyzerpy-cmei2ztkvoxewuk4kwyqre.streamlit.app/)

## Contributing
We welcome contributions! If you have suggestions for improvements or new features, please feel free to create a pull request or open an issue. 
Other data we are interested in extracting: generating learning outcomes based on scripts, age-ratings and difficult vocabulary tagging, colors predominantly used in videos, screen time of each character
